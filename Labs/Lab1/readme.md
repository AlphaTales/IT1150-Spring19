## IT1150 Lab 1

There are two parts of this lab, one is written (edit this readme.md file) and the other is hands-on (edit .html and .css files.) 

### Executive Summary
Here i will be talking about what is the W3C and its purpose and also about what are some key parts of web browsers.

### Part 1 Written:

#### The W3C
 What is the W3C and how is it important to web development?
 The W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the original architect of the World Wide Web. The organization's purpose is to develop open standards so that the Web evolves in a single direction rather than being splintered among competing factions.
 
 
 How is the W3C related to html and css?
 I think that the main relation between the W3C and any programming language is the fact that the W3C provides estandars for programmers to follow that way everyone is in the same page. But in my own experience using the site i think that it serves programmers as a resouce that can be used as a guide when it comes to HTML and CSS.
 

#### Usability, Cross-Browser Compatibility, Accessibility, Search Engine Optimization and Responsive Web Design

1-Web usability is the ease of use of a website. Some broad goals of usability are the presentation of information and choices in a clear and concise way, a lack of ambiguity and the placement of important items in appropriate areas. Another important element of web usability is ensuring that the content works on various devices and browsers.
2-Cross-browser compatibility is the ability of a website or web application to function across different browsers and degrade gracefully when browser features are absent or lacking.
3-In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability type or severity of impairment.
4-Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or webpage on a search engine results page (SERP) so as to make a company’s website more discoverable.
5-Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes


### Part 2 Hands-On:
1. Open your cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and traverse to the "Lab1" Files.  Take a screen shot of your success and name the file "Lab1Part2No1" Upload your screen shot to the Lab1 directory

2. Pick a theme for your site. Find at least one image and one external site that you would like to include. Upload the image to your repository (locally and then "push" it to GitHub / conversly "pull" changes on GitHub to your local repo)

3. Using the semantic elements: header, main and footer edit the included .html file to create your web page. Be sure to include the folowing tags in your page:
   1. h1/6, p, line break
   2. Anchor
   3. Image
   4. CSS Link
   5. List - ordered or unordered
   
4. Take a screen shot of your web page in the browser and name the file "Lab1Part2No3" Upload your image to the Lab1 directory
